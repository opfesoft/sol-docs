**Description of the fields**

### ID

Entry from item\_template

### locale

The language of the text.
Can have 8 values: deDE, esES, esMX, frFR, koKR, ruRU, zhCN, zhTW

### Name

Localized name of the item

### VerifiedBuild

This field is used by the AzerothCore Team to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files (ADB files for this one).

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.

If value is [-Client Build](../auth/realmlist.md "DB:Auth:realmlist") then it was parsed with WDB files from that specific [client build](../auth/realmlist.md#gamebuild "DB:Auth:realmlist") and manually edited later for some special necessity.
